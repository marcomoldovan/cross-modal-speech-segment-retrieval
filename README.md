# Cross-Modal Speech Segment Retrieval

We tackle the problem of learning a multimodal representation space for language in the form of text as well as speech. We contrastively align semantically similar text and speech segments in the representation space in order to enable cross-modal retrieval of speech segments given a text query and vice versa.
